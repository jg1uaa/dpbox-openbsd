If you are using a *BSD system, copy the file source/Makefile.*bsd to
source/Makefile. If you are using Linux, use source/Makefile.linux
(already copied to source/Makefile). If you are using Linux, but prefer
an installation into one single directory tree, copy source/Makefile.flat
to source/Makefile. This results in an "installed" dpbox in a subdirectory
of source/.

It is not a bad idea to check the installation directories in the first
few lines of the makefile, as they might differ between linux distributions.



To compile the package:

Change to the directory source/

type 
     make clean
     make dep
     make all



To install DPBOX in its various locations on the unix file system:

Change to the directory source/

type
     make install



Change to the cgi/ directory

read the README therein

and of course the documentation in documents/ as well as the release notes

DPBOX will be installed according to the linux file system standard, what
in other words means that it is cluttered across the file system ;)
The install script will create symbolic links to all these locations in the
main spool directory of dpbox, /var/spool/dpbox.

Additionally, the linux install script will add dpbox as a service
started in runlevels 2 and 3 to /sbin/init.d/ . You can start/stop DPBOX
with the script
/usr/local/sbin/rcdpbox (options start | stop | reload | restart | status )



If you want to uninstall dpbox, stop dpbox.
Then change to the directory source/

type
     make instclean

This removes all installed files and directory trees of dpbox.

To preserve the contents of the mailbox (as well as your configurations),
make instclean creates a backup tar archive /var/tmp/dpbox-instsave-xxx.tgz,
where xxx is the current date as of uninstalling the package. Keep in mind
that this archive could be quite large (depending on the contents of the
mailbox and file server).

To restore the files after installation of a new version of the package (that
is, after typing "make install"),

type
     make instrestore

This restores the contents of the mailbox. Please note that the configuration
files are restored as well, and this might be a bad idea when the new package
came with modified (extended) configuration files. In that case, make a copy
of the new configuration files BEFORE restoring the old ones and compare them
manually.



To ensure a restart of DPBOX after it has crashed, you should add something
like

xxx startproc /usr/local/sbin/dpbox -i /etc/dpbox/dpbox.ini

into your crontab (provided your system has startproc). Check the start file
for dpbox in /sbin/init.d/ for details. startproc takes care that only one
instance of dpbox is started.
