Release Notes dpbox v5.06.00 / 04.03.97

Changes since v5.05.00 / 12.02.97



Complete recoding of mail indexbase access. Now always look-ahead - buffered,
  increases compute speed and lowers memory usage. Shortens code, increases
  readability of code.

Recoded some low-level functions (mainly in pastrix.c). Shorter, faster. Had a
  real impact on DPBOX response times on slow computers.

Recoded password prompt generation for NETROM style passwords (five chars of a
  longer pw string). Avoids prompting for two same positions in a password.

New command "U U" (Usage U). Displays a tiny grafic of current dpbox CPU usage
  and user count.

Deleted code for keeping the bulletin id buffer in ram. Was totaly useless
  with linux, kept resources the system could better administer itself.
  (RAMBID in config.box no more valid)

Included a "disk full" check. Stops input operations to the bbs if free disk
  space in box/indexes or box/infofiles is lower than 5MB. Is indicated
  with a "disk full" prompt for sysops and a display in VERSION + output
  (and of course an error message for users trying to send mails).

DPBOX has a timer to keep forward connections alive for three minutes even
  if there is currently no data to send (idle delay). Now you may switch
  that delay off, either for single forward partners or for all partners.
  This may be useful for THEBOX forward partners (they have a limited user
  count and may be blocked if they have lots of forward partners) but also
  for partners connected in compressed forward (FBB, DPBOX), as this delay
  feature is most useful in temporary one-way forward connections (as pure
  ASCII forward is).
  In general, your decision should depend upon the speed a new connection to
  that partner could be opened. If it runs over many digipeaters with slow
  links, let it idle, if it is opened in a once, switch idling off.

  Detailed information: DPBOX idles for up to three minutes if
   a) more than one forward partner is logged in
   b) in ASCII forward if no data to send and DPBOX would have to send an F>
      (direction reversal)
   c) in compressed forward if no data to send and DPBOX would have to send
      an FQ (connection termination)

  To switch off idling per default, set SFIDLEDEFAULT OFF in box/config.box.
  To define idling for a specific forward partner, set SFIDLE ON/OFF in
    its sf definition file (sf/<call>.sf)

Fixed two errors in mailing list server. Should now work as announced in
  release.505

Mailing list majordomo now not only addressable with LSTSRV@Console_call
  but also Console_call@Console_call. Should help to avoid problems in
  networks with BBS systems altering the message flag from P to B if not
  addressed to a callsign.

Some time ago, Ulli, DL5HBF expanded the mailing list server functionality.
  A server Console_call@Console_call is addressable by anyone (if existing),
  so if you are maintaining your bbs through different sysops, it could be
  a good idea to install a listserver with your bbs callsign and subscribed
  by all of your sysops.

No more sending a message with a non-callsign-style sender field to a
  THEBOX forward partner. They mess up the sender field in that case
  and insert your bbs call as the sender.

Added one prompt macro (HELP PROMPT): "%w" is filled with read/sent kBytes
  of that user (by view of the bbs). (special wish of Charly, OE3KLU)

Now displaying not only system cpu load percentages in VERSION commands but
  also dpbox cpu load percentages.

In ACTIVITY command output now displaying user cpu time and percentage.
  User CPU percentage is a total value over the users login time, on 586
  CPUs usually you may expect a 0% display.

In "BBS <calll>" command, an eventually existing digimap.stn file now is
  scanned explicitely for a BBS entry ("MB") of the database file if several
  entries (multiple SSIDs) are existing.

If a sysop tries to alter the home bbs setting of a user and forgot to
  authenticate with password, MYBBS command is exited. (special wish of
  Dietmar, OE3DZW ;) Formerly, sysops home bbs was set to the users call.
