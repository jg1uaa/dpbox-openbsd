How to install the cgi extensions in this archive:

Copy the content of the "cgi" directory to your httpd's cgi directory. Use
the "cp -a" directive, otherwise you will lose the access attributes of the
cgi scripts contained therein.

Example: cd cgi/
         cp -a * /WWW/cgi/

The other files should be installed by make install of the package.
